# Example-voting-app
With help of docker-compose implemented the voting application which consisted of In-memory db redis, postgres, nodejs and linking them.
In this project initially we clone the readily available voting-app project [Voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app.git).
1) For better understanding we pull, build, run and link the containers manually.
2) The next step is doing the same with docker compose, which greatly helps if there are many services and many containers, just a yml file does the task.
